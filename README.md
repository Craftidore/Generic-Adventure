# Generic Adventure

This project is meant to be a small trial run for what will hopefully be a larger, semester-long coding project for fun.
This will be modeled off of a choose-your-own adventure game.

## Conventions

### Tabs

- **Tab size**: 2 spaces
- **Tabs or spaces**: Spaces should be used instead of tabs. The tab key should insert spaces by default. These settings should already be enabled.

### Naming conventions

- **camelCase** will be used for all variables and functions

### Counting loops

When using counting loops, wherein you need to do a thing x times, set the counter to 0 and loop until `counter < max` 
rather than setting the counter to 1 and looping until `counter <= max` unless you have a specific reason for counting from 1 instead of 0.
